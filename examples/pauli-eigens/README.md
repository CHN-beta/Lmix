# Example 1

## pauli-eigens

A simple program to calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the pauli matrices with the eigen C++ template library. The Makefile uses pkg-config for the cflags.

## Flake generation

The flake has been autogenerated using lmod2flake with the eigen module loaded:
```
$ nix run . -- ./examples/pauli-eigens -c intel23 -b bear -b pkg-config
```
The first argument specifies the target directory. The next option includes the gcc12 compilers (including gfortran) and sets the environment variables CC, CXX and FC to their respective commands. The final option specifies pkg-config as a build tool which is added to nativeBuildInputs in the flake. The nix build system then sets PKG_CONFIG_PATH to include eigen.

## Building

Building the program in a nix development environment works like expected:
```
$ nix develop
$ make
```
